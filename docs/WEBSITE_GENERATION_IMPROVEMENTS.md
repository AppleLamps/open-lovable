- **Interactive Elements**: Keep button styles and navigation behaviors

### 4. üñºÔ∏è Enhanced Image Handling & Optimization ‚úÖ

**Enhancement**: Advanced image management with performance and accessibility focus
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive image processing and fallback strategies

**Image Handling Features**:
- **Smart Fallbacks**: Error handling with meaningful placeholder images
- **Lazy Loading**: Performance optimization for below-the-fold images
- **Responsive Design**: Multiple sizes and proper aspect ratios
- **Accessibility**: Context-aware alt text generation
- **Security**: HTTPS enforcement and URL validation

**Example Implementation**:
```jsx
<img 
  src={originalImageUrl} 
  alt="Descriptive alt text"
  onError={(e) => { e.target.src = 'https://via.placeholder.com/400x300?text=Image+Not+Available' }}
  loading="lazy"
/>
```

### 5. ‚ôø Comprehensive Accessibility Guidelines ‚úÖ

**Enhancement**: Ensure all websites are accessible to users with disabilities
- **Implementation**: Detailed accessibility requirements integrated into system instructions

**Accessibility Features**:
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper heading hierarchy and landmark elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Focus states and keyboard accessibility
- **ARIA Labels**: Comprehensive labeling for interactive elements
- **Color & Contrast**: Minimum contrast ratios and color-independent design
- **Form Accessibility**: Proper labeling and error handling

**Focus State Example**:
```jsx
className="focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 focus:ring-offset-2"
```

### 6. ‚ö° Performance Optimization Guidelines ‚úÖ

**Enhancement**: Build fast, efficient websites with optimized loading
- **Implementation**: Performance best practices integrated throughout the generation process

**Performance Features**:
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading for components and images
- **Efficient Styling**: Optimized Tailwind usage and CSS practices
- **Image Optimization**: Proper formats, compression, and responsive images
- **JavaScript Performance**: Bundle size optimization and efficient rendering
- **Loading States**: Better user experience with loading indicators

## üîß Model Compatibility Considerations

### Image Processing Compatibility
**Issue**: Some AI models (like Kimi K2) do not support image input, which affects visual analysis capabilities.

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Text-Based Analysis**: Modified visual analysis to work with content structure rather than image data
- **Screenshot Reference**: Screenshots are captured for potential future use but not sent to AI models
- **Content Structure Focus**: Enhanced content analysis to infer layout patterns from markdown structure
- **Graceful Fallback**: System works effectively whether screenshot capture succeeds or fails

### Content-Based Visual Inference
Instead of direct image analysis, the system now:
- Analyzes heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) to understand information architecture
- Uses content sectioning and breaks to infer layout boundaries
- Identifies navigation patterns from link structures in scraped content
- Determines component organization from content grouping patterns
- Extracts brand personality from tone and messaging rather than visual elements

## üìà Impact of Improvements

### Before vs After

**Before**:
- Basic content scraping with markdown conversion
- Generic dark theme application
- Basic image URL preservation
- Limited accessibility considerations
- No visual analysis integration

**After**:
- Enhanced scraping with parallel screenshot capture
- Smart content structure detection and component organization
- Brand-aware design system preservation
- Comprehensive accessibility guidelines
- Performance optimization throughout
- Visual analysis integration for layout accuracy

### Key Benefits

1. **Higher Accuracy**: Visual analysis leads to more faithful recreations
2. **Better Accessibility**: Comprehensive a11y guidelines ensure inclusive design
3. **Improved Performance**: Optimized loading and rendering patterns
4. **Brand Preservation**: Maintains authentic visual identity while modernizing
5. **Smart Organization**: Intelligent component structure based on content analysis
6. **Enhanced UX**: Better error handling, loading states, and responsive design

## üîÑ Enhanced User Flow

### New Website Generation Process:

1. **User enters URL** ‚Üí Enhanced scraping begins
2. **Parallel Processing**: Content scraping + Screenshot capture
3. **Smart Analysis**: Content structure detection + Visual analysis
4. **Brand Extraction**: Color palette + Typography patterns
5. **Intelligent Organization**: Component boundary detection
6. **Accessible Generation**: A11y guidelines + Performance optimization
7. **Enhanced Recreation**: Modern, accessible, performant website

### Technical Implementation:

```typescript
// Enhanced scraping with visual analysis
const [scrapeResponse, screenshotResponse] = await Promise.allSettled([
  fetch('/api/scrape-url-enhanced', { /* content scraping */ }),
  fetch('/api/scrape-screenshot', { /* visual capture */ })
]);

// Smart prompt construction with visual data
const recreatePrompt = `
Enhanced analysis with:
- Content structure detection
- Visual hierarchy analysis  
- Brand preservation guidelines
- Accessibility requirements
- Performance optimization
`;
```

## üéØ Quality Assurance
